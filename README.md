# SPOJ-Solutions

Link: http://www.spoj.com/

I stumbled upon SPOJ yesterday and decided to test my programming skills. To my suprise, I struggled a lot when I tried to submit my solutions for some of the basic problems (yep, even on the basic ones) because I wasn't familiar with how the Ideone IDE worked and what was the criteria of accepting/rejecting a solution. After struggling quite a bit, I finally managed to submit a solution which was exactly what I had tried submitting in my first attempt, but with a little tweaks. On SPOJ, even if your program is logically correct, you need to understand that it's being marked by bots so it's following a predefined set of rules and guidelines. You need to submit a solution that strictly follows what's being asked, nobody wants pretty, user-friendly code at SPOJ. You need to have a to-the-point solution of the problems. 

I am creating this repository for two reasons:

  1) to brush up my programming skills in different languages because I'll be posting solutions in multiple languages
  2) to help fellow programmers get a hint of the solution even if their programs look logically correct
